The consequences are many and most importantly the reduction of yield and eventually low income, increase of un-cultivated land and consequently high levels of immigration. The individual and collective factors that cause excessive soil salinity is site specific and complicated. However, understanding the distribution and extent of these factors is indispensible to suggest effective remedial interventions. GIS and remote sensing are viable tools to facilitate this understanding. The activity aims at analyzing available data and capitalizing on local knowledge and expertise to map soil and water salinity and ultimately provide information about the distribution and causes of soil salinization.

18	1	1.3		9.IFPRI	1.3.6	Evaluating the impact of irrigation on ecosystem services (ES) and smallholder resilience in Nepal						 Zhang	FPRI	80 | Academic, Training and Research			Irrigation agriculture can make important contributions to food security, improved nutrition and rural prosperity. However, empirical evidence on the impact of irrigation on ES and smallholders’ resilience is lacking, with a few existing studies showing mixed results. For example, while some studies argue that irrigation contributes to crop diversity by extending the growing season and broadening crop choices, others show that irrigation leads to reduced crop diversity due to mono-cropped high yield varieties replacing local varieties. Evidence on the impact on land use change is also lacking. While some have argued that irrigation reduces pressure on the surrounding forest resource, grazing and marginal lands because of increased cropping intensification, others have suggested the reverse trend. The exact changes remain unclear and need to be quantified in order to understand the impact on natural/semi-natural and fragile ecosystems. Irrigation has the potential to help smallholders reduce their risks and vulnerability to shocks by diversifying activities. A deeper look is needed to understand how irrigation has contributed to farmers’ resilience, both positively and negatively, by addressing important factors such as access to irrigation, seasonality of irrigation, multiple use of water, and access to natural resources, accounting for changes in ES underlined by biodiversity, intensification, and land use change. The research will improve our understanding of the impact of small-scale irrigation schemes on ES and smallholders’ resilience to natural and socio-economic changes in the Terai plain of Nepal. We combine the Nepal Living Standards Survey data with primary data to be collected through village and household surveys. The survey follows a 2-stage random sampling design of agricultural communities and households within them, post-stratifying by income level, type of irrigation project, and spatial location in the scheme. Remote sensing data on land cover/use will be used to assess land use change before/after establishing the scheme.

It includes the characterization and modeling of shallow groundwater level dynamics, testing of water management schemes to increase the efficiency in the use of water, assessing soil carbon and nutrient dynamics and use efficiencies at different temporal and spatial scales. A limiting factor in modeling soil-carbon-nutrients-water relations across scales is the lack of good quality data at the resolutions needed. The research proposed focuses on generating and processing remotely sensed information to be used as ancillary data. To assess the robustness of the procedures tested, the theory will be developed in data-rich environments to ascertain the biases introduced as data scarcity increases. We propose using non-linear processes to characterize and model the processes of interest. Tools and methods will be programmed in open source software and national partners in developing countries will be trained in their use, once validated.

Patches of land on which MABES are enhanced can provide spatially far-reaching benefits, but a problem arises in fragmented smallholder farming landscapes as to whose land should become the host.  The land available to a farmer, along with the set of available inputs, shape the opportunity cost of keeping land in productive use; further, the structure and security of institutions for land tenure – held privately, collectively, or by the state – shape the incentives farmers have to make investments in farm structure. The goal of our research is to improve MABES management and reduce the use of chemical pesticides through coordinated action across farmers at the landscape scale. Our key research questions are:
1) How do farmer objectives, and incentives to coordinate, vary across property size and institutional arrangements for tenure?
2) What are the most appropriate interventions to optimize MABES management across these different size and institutional contexts?
We propose a three-year, three-country (Cambodia, Vietnam, China) study to design and evaluate incentives for MABES management, taking into account heterogeneity in property size and institutional arrangements for property rights that characterize China and Southeast Asia.  Our choice of countries leverages existing research in Northern China, and covers landscapes i) where smallholder properties are unvaryingly small (> 2ha; Cambodia, China, and areas in North Vietnam) as well as where some consolidation has occurred (> 10ha; Southern Vietnam); and ii) with different prevalence of private property rights (Southern Vietnam and China), collective farming systems (Northern Vietnam), and threats to tenure security (Cambodia).
Our research will combine modeling study with household survey.  Drawing on existing MABES research in China and published models of MABES provision, a spatially explicit agent-based model of agricultural households will be developed to i) propose candidate incentives for managing MABES and reducing pesticide use, and ii) identify key variables in farmer decision making for the household survey.  Survey research in chosen agricultural contexts (Cambodia, Southern Vietnam, Northern Vietnam, and Northern China) will follow a 2-stage random sampling design of agricultural communities and households within them, post-stratifying by wealth, property size, land tenure system, and current reliance on pesticides.  This survey research will inform the understanding of household level objective functions, decision-making criteria, and community network structure, and will feed back into a detailed agent-based model of farming decisions within the agricultural landscape.  Coupled to existing ecological models of MABES provision, we will apply this modeling framework to evaluating and comparing alternative incentives for MABES management and draw implications on reducing pesticides use.

Katherine Snyder	IWMI	80 | Academic, Training and Research			"Reducing the risks associated with rainfall variability that is an innate attribute of rainfed production systems is critical to enhancing the performance of these agricultural production systems. To best achieve this agricultural water management at both the field and landscape scales are seen as part of the mix of solutions to enhance the productivity of these systems. To achieve this ongoing and new initiatives that focus on improving agricultural water management have been mapped to this activity. The overarching objective of this initiative is to build a comprehensive cluster of projects that would contribute to Activity cluster 2.5.  
There are current activities that are ongoing that attempt to address the risk associated with rainfall variability in these environments through the role of enhancing the productivity of light textured soils through the addition of clay, organic matter, biochar and combinations thereof that are being evaluated under rainfed systems in Lao PDR. Over the coming year collection and analysis of data from structured field trials will be undertaken and presented in peer reviewed publications and reports.
A scoping study on opportunities to improving the sustainable utilization and management of water and soil resources for coastal Vietnam will be undertaken as a precursor to a larger project to be funded in mid-2013.
In the development of a comprehensive cluster of projects to be undertaken within the Rainfed SRP efforts will be made to formulate a suite of new projects that would contribute to the 5 activity clusters within the SRP. The following proposed research areas could be considered:
1. Building upon the outcomes from the CPWF suite of projects in the Nile and Volta, research proposals that focus on the role of termites in ecosystem services (N2) and fire as a management tool (V4) will be developed.
2. Understanding impediments to scaling up adoption rates in rainfed systems and developing strategies and options to obviate these barriers.
3. The role of supplemental irrigation in improving the productivity of rainfed systems.
4. Understanding the impacts of scaling up agricultural water management (AWM) interventions and optimizing in situ water storage.
This process will be undertaken in consultation with CGIAR centres aligned to SRP Rainfed, stakeholders and other interested parties through face to face meetings and virtual discussion groups.

This study will provide a coarse assessment of water pollution levels and indicators of water pollution based on an assessment of N, P and BOD for all countries and major river basins, based on a collection of domestic/industrial development and agricultural production across the globe that will be fed into a newly developed water quality module of the International Model of Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT). Based on the analytical framework and data, alternative water quality management scenarios can be implemented to identify cost-efficient options that reduce water pollution while contributing to enhanced growth and a better environment.

This activity aims at developing: 1)low-cost high resolution surveillance platforms for multiple applications and to 2) develop modeling tools to combine high resolution locally registered information with space-borne low-cost medium resolution satellite imageries. The research includes the development of methodologies and manuals to assemble low cost remote sensing devices (e.g. multispectral cameras, micro radiometers) and the software to make geometric and radiometric corrections and generating mosaics of imageries from contiguous registration. It also includes the development of algorithms to assess and modeling scaling issues. We also propose developing applications and data useful for decision makers such as crop statistics, biodiversity mapping, and agro-ecosystems health assessments. Tools and methods based on non-linear methodologies suitable to process and quantify data collected at different spatial and temporal resolutions will be programmed in open source software, training for end users and policy briefs will be provided as results are confirmed 	Global	Tanzania	Nile, Global (65/35)			331613	USD	CRP - Water, Land and Ecosystems	$231,613		$100,000	$331,613	65%									35%

We will do so via three studies that provide different windows into this relationship. Our work will shed light on features of the governance environment that deliver the best outcomes for poor, rural, and disadvantaged groups, and the best methods of ensuring that such features are in place.
In the first study, we will examine the effects of publicly-funded programs (including irrigation, roads, water, sanitation, and newly-introduced rural medical and old age insurance) on agricultural production, migration, nutrition, and poverty reduction in two lagging provinces in China (Guizhou and Sichuan). The study will focus in particular on what grassroots governance features best ensure high-quality and cost-effective services, and thus can facilitate economic development and poverty alleviation.
In the second study, we will analyze what factors best promote effective and efficient public service delivery in rural Bihar, India. We will study such factors as the identity and incentives of policymakers, the nature of linkages between governments at different levels, and the degree of decentralization of responsibility for provision. One vehicle for studying this will be an analysis of public healthcare provision, given rich and novel data on this particular service. We will pair service data (from 800 public healthcare workers in 400 villages) with usage data (from a survey of 6,000 households in the same villages) to analyze the institutional determinants of access to and quality of healthcare. Using a community survey, we will additionally analyze other public goods.
The third study will pair data from a survey of 2,000 households in 76 rural villages in Pakistan (who reported on all aspects of economic activity) with data from village focus groups in each village. Focus groups were asked myriad questions about the governance and institutional environment, including the participation of women in local politics.

For this purpose, selected interventions of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA), now more popularly referred to as NREGA, will be evaluated on key indicators of program objectives such as poor households’ labor market participation, income variability and livelihood assets, agricultural productivity, wages, agricultural production, asset creation and rural livelihoods of the program participants. The impact study will be done in selected 18 villages belonging to SAT regions in five states of India (SAT-India): Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh. The villages selected for this study are located where ICRISAT has been collecting high frequency based comprehensive panel data survey of about 800 households since early 2009. In fact, in six villages - 2 in Andhra Pradesh and 4 villages in Maharashtra, ICRISAT Village Level Studies (VLS) has continued to collect comprehensive data on different aspect of household behavior since 1975. The VLS data set provide good baseline information for ex-post impact assessment of the NREGA intervention in SAT Indian villages, and will be complemented in the proposed CRP2 Activity 30 by a special purpose survey in the same VLS villages with focus on relevant NREGA issues. The study will harness village level responses and analyze process related factors underpinning the NREGA program in targeted villages.
CRP2 Activity 30 proposes to study the impacts of the social safety nets program of NREGA in SAT India by analyzing the differential and heterogeneous benefits of the program on rural households and in particular assessing the program impacts on men and women, by age, and wealth group. Mixed method impact assessment will be applied by integrating both quantitative and qualitative survey data, and by adopting quasi-experimental design, that is including regression discontinuity design (RDD) and propensity score matching (PSM), along with panel data modeling techniques. This approach will be used to handle the counterfactual question on what would happen to program participants had they not participated in their community’s NREGA program before 2008. Likewise, focus group discussions (FGDs) and participatory impact assessment (PIA) will also be conducted to complement the survey results to achieve a more in-depth understanding on process impacts and possible wider implications of the NREGA program activities in the targeted communities at different scales (communities, households, and individual members). This application of the mixed method approach enables analysis of the impact pathway and process impacts at different scales.

Some of the existing institutional innovations and opportunities for value chain interventions in the production, processing and marketing sub-sectors that have potential in involving smallholder farmers of dryland cereals and legumes will be reviewed and their potential for scaling-up assessed.

* CRP Mapping Status Report
#+DATE: {{{modification-time(%Y-%m-%d)}}}

A [[fig:map2][country-level map]] showing the count of CGIAR research programs by country was generated for the November Fund Council Meeting. A [[fig:map1][PDF version]] is also available for download. These maps use information collected from the latest CRP Progress Reports (2012), personal communications with CRP Focal Points, and other data found over the Web and in various reports. All country locations have been validated prior to the Meeting.

Other maps contributed throughout 2013 by members of the Consortium for Spatial Infrastructure (CSI) are catalogued on [[fig:map3][ArcGISOnline]].

We are now referencing all activity locations at the district level (administrative level 2) into a new on-line platform (dubbed [[http://crps.harvestchoice.org/dev/][/CRP Mapper/]]). We will then request Activity Leaders (when identified) to review and validate these locations, and fill out missing details using the simplified web-based entry forms in /CRP Mapper/. This task is on-going and we expect sending initial requests mid-March 2014. 

This approach aims at harmonizing as much spatial information as is currently available from the individual CRP teams using a set of standardized annotations (e.g. activity codes, titles, descriptions, contact, target technologies, research theme, etc...). A full list of attributes is shown in [[tbl:cross][Table 1]] below. To the extent possible we are following recommendations from the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) and using standard semantic, such that CGIAR activities may be mapped against investments from national aid agencies and development partners (e.g. [[http://aiddata.org/dashboard#/advanced/map][AidData]]).

In this process we are also building CGIAR-wide dictionaries to repertory and summarize CRP investments across key dimensions, i.e.

- Program :: =<cg-program>= CGIAR or SRO funding mechanism - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_programs.csv
- SLO :: =<cg-slo>= 1 of 4 CGIAR strategic-level outcomes - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_slos.csv
- CGIAR IDO :: =<cg-ido>= 1 of 11 CGIAR intermediate development outcomes - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_idos.csv
- CRP IDOs :: =<cg-crp-ido>= CRP-specific IDO - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_crp_idos.csv
- Technologies :: =<cg-technologies>= Any agricultural _technologi(es)_ and/or _practice(s)_ tested, implemented, targeted, or adopted as a result of an activity - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_technologies.csv
- Organizations :: =<cg-organizations>= Directory of CGIAR organizations and partners (used to populate elements =<reporting-organisation>= and =<participating-organisation>=) - [codelist and concordance with IATI is under development] https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_organizations.csv
- Organization Types :: =<cg-organization-type>= CGIAR organization type codelist - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_organization_type.csv
- Collaboration Types :: =<cg-collaboration-type>= Category of funding mechanisms - https://github.com/harvestchoice/hc-crp/blob/master/vocabularies/cg_collaboration_type.csv

All CGIAR codelists are available on Github. The =<cg-organizations>= element is under construction. Some of these dictionaries were presented and discussed at the CGIAR Data Summit in Rome, Nov. 26-28 2013.

| <2014-01-17> update: response from Marianne to Karen's request | 1. Maize and Wheat germplasm GPS locations of germplasm collaborators were sent by Kai Sonders for maize and whea. The collaborators, not CG research, deploy maize and wheat and we have no contractual basis or data capture tools to better define the actual location of deployment (companies sell seed, they do not follow where it is being planted and what age and gender that farmer had; farmers do not send us texts to state that they planted CG maize or wheat; the SMTA does not have a contractual obligation to state on a seed bag "CGinside"". 2. Maize and wheat-based systems research locations >> on farm coordinates were sent by Kai Sonders. 3. We could provide collaborating countries by cluster of activities, but no more detailed info. | Marianne Banziger                                            |

| <2013-01-17> update and ppt: response from Bouman to Karen's request | There are over 200 bilaterally-funded projects under GRiSP, that 'come and go' in time and space, and progress in time and space with types of activities. Though we have a good idea what we are doing, we don't have a map/database at hand as you are looking for. What we have now is the map with partners locations. AfricaRice has an interactive google map that contains info that you are looking for I believe, but obviously only for AfricaRice's GRiSP work in Africa. You may contact *Sander Zwart* for details. Some projects have good underlying GIS databases, but many don't. For Asia, two important projects under GRiSP are CSISA and STRASA, and you can contact the project leaders to ask what geographic databases/information they have: *Andy McDonald* at CIMMYT for CSISA (joint GRiSP, MAIZE, WHEAT project), *Umesh Singh* for STRASA, and *Thimothy Russell* for CSISA-Bangladesh. This would still only cover most our work in S. Asia, but would not give details on our work on the ground in SE Asia. There, we just have so many projects that it would take so much time I'm afraid. But the attached maps give an indication; they all refer to on-the-ground R&D activities such as development and dissemination of improved rice production and post-harvest technologies (covering such things as new rice varieties, new management and cropping system technologies, climate change R&D, post-harvest on improved drying, milling, processing and storage of rice. Finally for Latin America, you may contact *Edgar Torres*, leader of the CIAT-GRiSP rice program, and *Eduardo Graterol* who is the Executive Director of the FLAR consortium.

     :PROPERTIES: 
     :source: Bouman Das
     :status: There are over 200 bilaterally-funded projects under GRiSP, that 'come and go' in time and space, and progress in time and space with types of activities. Though we have a good idea what we are doing, we don't have a map/database at hand as you are looking for. What we have now is the map with partners locations. AfricaRice has an interactive google map that contains info that you are looking for I believe, but obviously only for AfricaRice's GRiSP work in Africa. You may contact *Sander Zwart* for details. Some projects have good underlying GIS databases, but many don't. For Asia, two important projects under GRiSP are CSISA and STRASA, and you can contact the project leaders to ask what geographic databases/information they have: *Andy McDonald* at CIMMYT for CSISA (joint GRiSP, MAIZE, WHEAT project), *Umesh Singh* for STRASA, and *Thimothy Russell* for CSISA-Bangladesh. This would still only cover most our work in S. Asia, but would not give details on our work on the ground in SE Asia. There, we just have so many projects that it would take so much time I'm afraid. But the attached maps give an indication; they all refer to on-the-ground R&D activities such as development and dissemination of improved rice production and post-harvest technologies (covering such things as new rice varieties, new management and cropping system technologies, climate change R&D, post-harvest on improved drying, milling, processing and storage of rice. Finally for Latin America, you may contact *Edgar Torres*, leader of the CIAT-GRiSP rice program, and *Eduardo Graterol* who is the Executive Director of the FLAR consortium. HC to compile documents, maps and website.

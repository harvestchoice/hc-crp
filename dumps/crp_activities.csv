Building on an on-going IFPRI project which evaluates the impact of a national community-driven development project on sustainable land management practices in Nigeria (FADAMA III), this study examines the contribution of ES (or indicators of ES) to agricultural productivity, income, and household food and nutrition security. The study will also explore the role of landscape diversity in the provision of pest control service and honey production.

We pay particular attention to the repayment decisions of groups and their members to uncover the main factors underlying their decisions. We propose and apply a new methodology to overcome the omitted variable problem resulting from peer selection and enforcement, which is inherent in group lending models. In addition, we will conduct a household survey in Bangladesh where the microfinance model is to be implemented to analyze the drivers behind group formation and provide a more integral assessment of the innovative microfinance model. The study will have important policy implications. In particular, the findings of the study can help policymakers to improve the design of microfinance programs, can help lenders to screen self- help groups, and can guide SHGs and their federations to improve repayment performance and sustainability..

These contributions include higher and more diversified incomes, improved diets for rural and urban consumers, and increased resilience of smallholder production systems. However, the development of markets for UUF has faced major challenges on both the demand and supply side, including limited awareness by consumers, irregular quantities and quality of supply, and limited technologies for production and processing. Can value chain development (VCD) contribute to overcoming these challenges while at the same time contribute to reduced rural poverty? This research aims to understand the potential to develop viable value chains for UUF and the related implications for achieving poverty reduction goals. Research will be carried out in 3 countries, Cameroon, Kenya, and Peru. In each country, 2 case studies will be carried out on UUF value chains. Preference will be given to national and regional-level chains. Case studies will aim to understand the assets endowments and strategies of smallholders linked to the chains, as well as the assets and strategies of the selected businesses along the chain. Cases will assess the contributions of VCD-related interventions to asset building by smallholders and small-scale businesses. Special attention will be placed on the role of the political, level, and institutional context in determining the opportunities for VCD.

In the first study, we will examine the effects of publicly-funded programs (including irrigation, roads, water, sanitation, and newly-introduced rural medical and old age insurance) on agricultural production, migration, nutrition, and poverty reduction in two lagging provinces in China (Guizhou and Sichuan). The study will focus in particular on what grassroots governance features best ensure high-quality and cost-effective services, and thus can facilitate economic development and poverty alleviation.
In the second study, we will analyze what factors best promote effective and efficient public service delivery in rural Bihar, India. We will study such factors as the identity and incentives of policymakers, the nature of linkages between governments at different levels, and the degree of decentralization of responsibility for provision. One vehicle for studying this will be an analysis of public healthcare provision, given rich and novel data on this particular service. We will pair service data (from 800 public healthcare workers in 400 villages) with usage data (from a survey of 6,000 households in the same villages) to analyze the institutional determinants of access to and quality of healthcare. Using a community survey, we will additionally analyze other public goods.

- the role of different institutions in empowering women’s participation in economic and socio-cultural-political activities and improving food and nutritional security of the households;
- documentation of the requirements and nutrient intakes of rural men and women temporally and spatially to understand shift in their nutritional status due to changes in levels of physical activity (eg. mechanization of agriculture) and change in lifestyle.

For this purpose, selected interventions of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA), now more popularly referred to as NREGA, will be evaluated on key indicators of program objectives such as poor households’ labor market participation, income variability and livelihood assets, agricultural productivity, wages, agricultural production, asset creation and rural livelihoods of the program participants. The impact study will be done in selected 18 villages belonging to SAT regions in five states of India (SAT-India): Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh. The villages selected for this study are located where ICRISAT has been collecting high frequency based comprehensive panel data survey of about 800 households since early 2009. In fact, in six villages - 2 in Andhra Pradesh and 4 villages in Maharashtra, ICRISAT Village Level Studies (VLS) has continued to collect comprehensive data on different aspect of household behavior since 1975. The VLS data set provide good baseline information for ex-post impact assessment of the NREGA intervention in SAT Indian villages, and will be complemented in the proposed CRP2 Activity 30 by a special purpose survey in the same VLS villages with focus on relevant NREGA issues. The study will harness village level responses and analyze process related factors underpinning the NREGA program in targeted villages.
CRP2 Activity 30 proposes to study the impacts of the social safety nets program of NREGA in SAT India by analyzing the differential and heterogeneous benefits of the program on rural households and in particular assessing the program impacts on men and women, by age, and wealth group. Mixed method impact assessment will be applied by integrating both quantitative and qualitative survey data, and by adopting quasi-experimental design, that is including regression discontinuity design (RDD) and propensity score matching (PSM), along with panel data modeling techniques. This approach will be used to handle the counterfactual question on what would happen to program participants had they not participated in their community’s NREGA program before 2008. Likewise, focus group discussions (FGDs) and participatory impact assessment (PIA) will also be conducted to complement the survey results to achieve a more in-depth understanding on process impacts and possible wider implications of the NREGA program activities in the targeted communities at different scales (communities, households, and individual members). This application of the mixed method approach enables analysis of the impact pathway and process impacts at different scales.
High quality research reports, policy briefs, and journal papers (3) will be prepared, and shared widely. A project completion workshop will be organized during year 3 of the project, inviting senior policy makers and decision makers in rural development sectors in India. Capacity development and knowledge sharing across the states of India, and from Asia to Africa using ICRISAT network of research, are other major milestones of the proposed activity. Depending upon availability of funding from other sources in 2013 and 2014, ICRISAT is likely to initiate a similar study in West Africa, targeting first Niger and Burkina Faso using the VLS panel survey data collected in West Africa since the 80s with recent follow-up surveys in the mid-2000s.",,,578632,,,2,CRP-2,CRP 2,to_update,,CG-IDO-08,,CRP2-IDO-06,,53|52,Economic and policy technology|Educational technology,,"",,ICRISAT - Work plan (Annex 2 PPA),"ICRISAT - Work plan (Annex 2 PPA)| Pascale Sabbagh (IFPRI), geocoded by DG - IFPRI_CRP2 geoANDanalysis_final.xlsx",Effective Policies and Strategic Investments(theme);Social Protection Policies-1.4(st);1.4.2|1.4.3|1.4.4(op),0,

Market access is particularly important for wider adoption of new technologies of dryland cereals and legumes. Value chain interventions and institutional innovations in marketing will improve not only access to markets, but also access to quality inputs/outputs, technology, information and services. Specifically, the research activity will focus on understanding the structure, conduct and performance of selected value chains (pearl millet, sorghum, groundnut, pigeon pea and chickpea), identifying up-grading options and piloting institutional innovations in selected sites and countries. Some of the existing institutional innovations and opportunities for value chain interventions in the production, processing and marketing sub-sectors that have potential in involving smallholder farmers of dryland cereals and legumes will be reviewed and their potential for scaling-up assessed. Business models requiring both public-private sector investments in up-gradation of value chain interventions, development of value added products (through post-harvest processing) will be assessed.
